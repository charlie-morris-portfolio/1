alt: Charlie Morris wins 2024 Puckhead Award, Notre Dame Observer hockey coverage
description: Beyond just my work with MyRye.com, I have contributed to other media organizations. I periodically write for the 
  Notre Dame Observer, writing about St. Mary's College and Notre Dame Sports. I earned the Puckhead Award for proficient coverage
  of the 2024 ND hockey team as they got set for playoffs. <a href="https://www.ndsmcobserver.com/staff/charlie-morris"> Find my
  full Observer portfolio here.</a>
  <br>
  I also started a hockey blogging account in 2017, which peaked in 2019, when I claimed the Best Blogger Award for the website
  (Chel Amino) that year. I still engage with fellow hockey fans and blog occasionally. Chel Amino was an integral part of my
  development as a writer throughout middle and high school. <a href="http://aminoapps.com/p/gqspm6"> Visit my account here.</a>
