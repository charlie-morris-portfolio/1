description: I collected several clips from both my sports broadcasts and news broadcasts from the Fall 2024 semester
  at Notre Dame. This includes work behind a news desk and out in the field, as well as color commentary for volleyball
  and play-by-play for rugby, women's basketball (radio), and hockey (radio). I look forward to keeping this updated,
  especially as I get more reps on the winter sports and move into baseball and softball in the spring.
