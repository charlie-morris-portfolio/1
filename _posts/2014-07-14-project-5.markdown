description: I have been the primary manager for the Instagram (and later Facebook) account for my family's new non-profit
  organization, the JMH Family Fund. I am in charge of posting on a regular basis and increasing brand name awareness. The
  Instagram page consistently gets over 1,000 views per month despite being just over one year old. <a `              href="https://www.instagram.com/jmh.family.fund/"> Follow us on Instagram here.</a>

  At Notre Dame, I am the President of the Hockey Analytics Club. Since freshman year, I have overseen the club grow from 3 members to 12
  and communication with the coaching staff improve from unseen emails to direct contact. We scout ND hockey opponents using private data,
  and turn thousands of stats into a one-page report on a weekly basis.

  When at home in New York, I work as a hockey skills coach for Erik Nates Euro Hockey. This job has helped greatly with professional
  development, networking skills, commitment, and more. I have risen the ranks in the company and now take on more responsibility per
  shift. Shifts vary in length and location, and differ from summer camps to in-season team workouts. No matter what, I always
  bring the energy.
