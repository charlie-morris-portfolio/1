description: I have been the primary manager for the Instagram (and later Facebook) account for my family's new non-profit
  organization, the JMH Family Fund. I am in charge of posting on a regular basis and increasing brand name awareness. The
  Instagram page regular gets over 1,000 views per month despite being just over one year old.
