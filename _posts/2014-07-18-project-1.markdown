description: I started at MyRye.com as a head editor and reporter for the organization's summer 2024 internship program.
  After a great summer of reporting, writing, editing, and managing seven other interns, my boss Mr. Jay Sears offered me
  a part-time hybrid role of 10 hours per week as a staff writer. I shifted my focus to Rye High School varsity sports,
  and continued to serve as the top fill-in to take breaking news stories if Mr. Sears needed assistance. I regularly 
  conduct interviews with coaches for preseason outlook stories and postgame recaps. I take pride in my ability to 
  incorporate quotes and stats into prose to create informative yet digestible stories, both about sports and other
  topics. <a href="https://myrye.com/author/charlie-morris/">See more here.</a>
